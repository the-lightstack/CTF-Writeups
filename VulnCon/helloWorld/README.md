# Hello World - Reversing

This simple Reversing Challenge provided you with a windows executable. 

You  could simply extract the flag by running `strings HelloWorld.exe` then you will see `GibFlagPlox` .

Then run `.\HelloWorld.exe` or `wine ./HelloWorld.exe` and input `GibFlagPlox`.

The binary will spit out the flag:

**VULNCON{H3110_W0r1D_70_W0r1D_0F_r3V3r51N6}**
